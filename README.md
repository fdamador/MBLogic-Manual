MBLogic-Manual
==============

The compilation of MBLogic.Sourceforge.net project's HMTL pages into a word and PDF document.

  http://mblogic.sourceforge.net/
  
I like Python a lot and many Supervisor Control and Data Aquisition (SCADA) softwares.  I found MBLogic, a python based SCADA application by Michael Griffin, on SourceForge.net and decided to create a word document based on the current HTML web pages.  I did this for two reasons, 1) quick searching capabilities and 2) for good reading material on mobile devices.

The end result are these word and PDF documents.

Enjoy!
